# Database Migration System Setup

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive database migration system for the gogent application. This system ensures that the database schema is properly managed and versioned, replacing the previous ad-hoc approach.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Schema Dump
- ✅ Dumped the current database schema from the live database
- ✅ Created `sql/current_schema_dump.sql` with the exact current state
- ✅ Analyzed differences between current schema and original `schema.sql`

### 2. Migration System Implementation
- ✅ Created migration directory structure (`sql/migrations/`)
- ✅ Implemented migration tracking table (`000_create_migrations_table.sql`)
- ✅ Created initial migration with current schema (`001_initial_schema.sql`)
- ✅ Built Go migration manager (`internal/db/migrations.go`)

### 3. Migration Manager Features
- ✅ **Automatic Migration Detection**: Scans migration directory for new files
- ✅ **Checksum Validation**: Detects when migration content changes
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: All migrations run in transactions
- ✅ **Status Tracking**: Records migration status, timing, and errors
- ✅ **Rollback Support**: Framework for handling failed migrations

### 4. Integration with Application
- ✅ **Automatic Startup**: Migrations run automatically when gogent client starts
- ✅ **Standalone Tool**: `cmd/migrate/main.go` for manual migration management
- ✅ **Make Commands**: Added migration commands to Makefile
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of migration failures

### 5. Migration Commands
```bash
# Run all pending migrations
make migrate

# Show migration status
make migrate-status

# Build migration tool
make build-migrate

# Manual migration tool
go run cmd/migrate/main.go -status
```

## Migration Files Created

### `sql/migrations/000_create_migrations_table.sql`
- Creates the `schema_migrations` tracking table
- Stores migration metadata (name, checksum, status, timing)
- Must be applied first

### `sql/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
- Contains the complete current database schema
- Includes all tables: function_definitions, execution_runs, api_configurations, etc.
- Preserves the exact current state as the baseline

## Key Features

### Automatic Migration on Startup
When the gogent client starts, it automatically:
1. Connects to the database
2. Ensures the migrations table exists
3. Scans for pending migrations
4. Applies any new migrations
5. Continues with normal operation

### Migration Safety
- **Transactions**: Each migration runs in a transaction
- **Checksums**: Migration content is checksummed to detect changes
- **Error Tracking**: Failed migrations are recorded with error details
- **Reapplication**: Changed migrations are automatically reapplied

### Migration Status Tracking
The system tracks:
- Migration name and content
- Application timestamp
- Execution time
- Success/failure status
- Error messages (if any)

## Testing Results

✅ **Migration System Tested**:
- Successfully applied both migration files
- Migration status correctly tracked
- Database schema matches expected state

✅ **Integration Tested**:
- Migration system integrated into gogent client
- Automatic migration on startup works
- Standalone migration tool functions correctly

## Benefits

1. **Version Control**: Database schema is now versioned and tracked
2. **Environment Consistency**: All environments stay in sync
3. **Deployment Safety**: Schema changes are applied safely
4. **Rollback Capability**: Framework for handling migration failures
5. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work with schema changes
6. **Production Safety**: Schema changes are tested before production

## Next Steps

### For Future Schema Changes
1. Create new migration file: `002_add_new_feature.sql`
2. Test migration locally
3. Commit migration file
4. Deploy - migrations run automatically

### Example New Migration
```sql
-- Migration: 002_add_user_preferences.sql
-- Description: Add user preferences table
-- Created: 2025-07-25

CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    preference_key VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    preference_value JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## Migration Best Practices

1. **One Change Per Migration**: Keep migrations focused and small
2. **Test Locally**: Always test migrations before committing
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive migration names
4. **Include Rollback**: Consider how to undo changes if needed
5. **Document Changes**: Include clear descriptions in migration headers

The migration system is now fully operational and will ensure the database schema remains consistent across all environments.
